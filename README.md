# CodeAlpha_Unemployment_Rate_India
## Brief Discription
Exploratory Data Analysis Project where we study the unemployment rate in India during the Covid-19 pandemic. We look at trends and discuss observations.
## Detailed Discription
The dataset is found in kaggle under:`Unemployment in India`
### Exploring Dataset
We started by data cleaning and preparation such as, removing extra white places in the variable names, manipulating missing values, etc. The following steps were made up of gaining insights of the data components. We did several lines of code to get information about the data from several POVs. 
We visualized the records to make sure that the data is consistent over all the regions and areas.
### Analysis and Visualizations
The goal of the visualizations is to tell a story that is hidden within the dataset records. The use of line plot illustrates the trend over time. Plotting the mean unemployment rate against the date, showed `Unemployment Rate Over Time`. This lead us to use bar graph to make a comparison between two specific dates, June 2019 and June 2020. We did comparison between these dates for each specific city/region.

We also visualized the unemployment trend for Delhi, the capital, and Puducherry, a city whose work force, as observed, was mostly effected by Covid-19 pandemic.

Finally, we took another dimention for the analysis, where we studied the `Unemployment Rate over time by Area (Rural vs Urban)`. This line plot showed the variation of unemployment rate between rural and urban areas.
